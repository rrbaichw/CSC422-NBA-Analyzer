# CSC422-NBA-Analyzer Instructions

## Overview
This project includes four datasets: two team datasets and two player datasets. Users can analyze NBA statistics from the years 2017 and 2022.

## Configuring File Paths
The datasets are referenced in the code by variables that specify the file paths. You can modify these variables as needed to point to the correct files. By default, the paths are set to:

```python
player_file_path = 'nba_stats_2017.csv'
team_stats_file_path = 'team_stats2017.csv'
```

## Available Datasets
Depending on the analysis year, the datasets may correspond to 2017 or 2022. To switch the dataset year, update the file path variables accordingly. For example, to analyze data from 2022, change the variables to:

```python
player_file_path = 'nba_stats_2022.csv'
team_stats_file_path = 'team_stats2022.csv'
```

## Usage Instructions
To run the analyses:

1. Open the project in Google Colab or your preferred Python environment.
2. Ensure that the file paths in the script are correctly set to point to the dataset files you intend to analyze.
3. Run the scripts as per the usual execution process of your environment.
